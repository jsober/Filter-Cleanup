=head1 NAME

Filter::Cleanup - Execute cleanup statements when scope closes, regardless of errors

=head1 VERSION

version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Filter::Cleanup;

  open my $fh, $file_path or die $!;
  cleanup { close $fh };
  do_risky_stuff_with_fh($fh);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines a block of code to be evaluated once the current scope has completed
execution. If an error is thrown during the execution of statements after the
C<cleanup> block, the error is trapped and rethrown after the C<cleanup> block
is executed.

Filter::Cleanup

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 ORDERING OF CLEANUP BLOCKS

A cleanup block will execute ahead of any cleanups defined before it. That is,
for a given scope, cleanup blocks will be called in the opposite order in which
they were declared.

=head2 IMPLEMENTATION

This module was originally implemented as a source filter (hence the name), but
now uses L<Keyword::Declare>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 Guard

L<Guard> is implemented in XS and attaches a code block to the actual stack
frame, ensuring it is executed regardless of how the scope was exited. In many
cases, this may be preferable to the behavior of C<Filter::Cleanup>, which will
not be executed if the block calls C<exit> or C<goto> (note that C<last> I<is>
handled correctly).
